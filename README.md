Welcome to this repository containing a collection of programming exercises and examples covering fundamental programming concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms. This repository is designed to serve as a learning resource for beginners and intermediate programmers seeking to enhance their skills in these areas.

### Repository Structure
The repository is structured into four main directories:

### python: 
Contains basic programming exercises and examples using Python, covering syntax, variables, data types, operators, control flow statements, functions, and modules.

### oops: 
Explores object-oriented programming concepts using Python, including classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

### data-structures: 
Delves into various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with their implementation and applications using Python.

### algorithms: 
Introduces fundamental algorithms such as sorting algorithms (insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (linear search, binary search), and recursion, implemented using Python.
